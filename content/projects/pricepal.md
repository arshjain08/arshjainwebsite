The inspiration for PricePal came from a personal experience while shopping at Best Buy. I was about to purchase a USB WiFi adapter priced at $40 when I decided to check Amazon for comparison. The same product was available for $15, representing a potential $25 overpayment. This experience highlighted a common problem in modern retail where consumers often miss better deals across multiple platforms due to time constraints or simply forgetting to check alternative sources.

PricePal was developed to address this challenge through augmented reality technology, integrating with Mentra smart glasses to provide real-time price comparison capabilities. The system uses voice activation with commands like "Hey Mentra, is this a good price?" to trigger the comparison process. Our AI-powered application instantly recognizes products using advanced computer vision, compares prices across multiple online retailers in real-time, and provides intelligent analysis on whether the current pricing represents good value, all through hands-free voice interaction.

The system architecture employs a dual-flow design to accommodate different Mentra glasses capabilities. The camera flow utilizes session.camera.requestPhoto() for product image capture, processes images through backend systems using Roboflow for computer vision, and delivers results via session.audio.speak() using ElevenLabs voice synthesis. The display flow handles image processing from mobile camera input and presents price comparisons through multiple display methods. Voice processing implements session.events.onTranscription() for activation phrase detection and supports natural language command processing.

The system leverages Google Gemini 2.5 Flash for dual-purpose functionality, first extracting item descriptions from captured images using advanced vision capabilities, and second retrieving real-time pricing data from multiple online retailers through grounding and URL context analysis. MentraOS integration provides comprehensive SDK access, enabling webhook-based real-time communication, advanced voice processing capabilities, and direct camera hardware access for seamless user interaction.

PricePal was developed for the Mentra Hackathon and received notable recognition from the organizing team and community. The project was personally highlighted by Mentra's CEO and leadership team, generating significant social media engagement and demonstrating practical augmented reality applications beyond entertainment use cases. The implementation showcased voice-first design principles and multi-modal AR experiences, illustrating how augmented reality technology can address real-world consumer challenges and provide tangible value in daily decision-making processes.
