# Content Management Guide

## üöÄ Quick Start

Your website is now fully data-driven and responsive! Here's how to easily add new content:

### Adding Blog Posts

**Method 1: Use the Script (Recommended)**
```bash
node scripts/add-content.js
# Choose "blog" when prompted
```
- This now also creates a Markdown file at `content/blog/<slug>.md` with frontmatter.
- Edit that Markdown file to write your post (headings, lists, code blocks supported via GFM).

**Method 2: Edit Manually**
- Add metadata to `data/blog.json` (used for lists and filters)
- Write full content in `content/blog/<slug>.md`

### Adding Projects

**Method 1: Use the Script (Recommended)**
```bash
node scripts/add-content.js
# Choose "project" when prompted
```
- This now creates `content/projects/<slug>.md` with frontmatter.
- Edit that Markdown file for the detailed project write-up.

**Method 2: Edit Manually**
- Add metadata to `data/projects.json`
- Write full content in `content/projects/<slug>.md`

## üì± Responsive Design

The website now scales beautifully across all screen sizes:

- **Mobile (320px+)**: Optimized typography, mobile navigation menu
- **Tablet (640px+)**: Improved spacing and layout
- **Desktop (1024px+)**: Full desktop experience
- **Large screens (1440px+)**: Enhanced typography for better readability

### Key Improvements:
- ‚úÖ Responsive typography that scales with screen size
- ‚úÖ Mobile-first navigation with hamburger menu
- ‚úÖ Flexible grid layouts that adapt to screen width
- ‚úÖ Touch-friendly buttons and links on mobile
- ‚úÖ Optimized spacing and padding for each breakpoint

## üìù Content Structure

### Blog Post Schema (JSON metadata)
```json
{
  "id": "your-post-slug",
  "title": "Your Post Title",
  "excerpt": "Brief description for previews",
  "date": "2024-01-01",
  "category": "technical" | "personal",
  "tags": ["tag1", "tag2"],
  "readTime": "5 min read",
  "featured": true | false
}
```
- Full content lives in `content/blog/<slug>.md` (frontmatter optional).

### Project Schema (JSON metadata)
```json
{
  "id": "your-project-slug",
  "title": "Project Name",
  "description": "Project description",
  "tech": ["React", "Node.js"],
  "category": "machine-learning" | "finance" | "web-development" | "creative",
  "status": "completed" | "in-progress",
  "featured": true | false,
  "github": "https://github.com/...",
  "demo": "https://demo-url.com",
  "image": "/images/projects/project-name.jpg"
}
```
- Full write-up lives in `content/projects/<slug>.md`.

## üåà Customization

### Adding New Categories

**For Blog Posts:**
1. Add to `categories` array in `data/blog.json`
2. Update color schemes in the blog page components if needed

**For Projects:**
1. Add to `categories` array in `data/projects.json`
2. Include a `color` property for the category

### Adding Images
- Place project images in `public/images/projects/`
- Use the filename pattern: `project-id.jpg`
- Images are automatically referenced in project pages
